# Messaging app

## About 
This project aims to create a backend for a messaging application in Java, implementing various user stories as HTTP APIs following REST principles. Users can create accounts, send messages to each other, and view their received and sent messages. All messages are persisted in PostgreSQL, and sending messages puts them on a queue using a messaging system like Kafka.

## Features

Non-users can create their accounts by providing a unique nickname.

### Sending Messages:

Users cannot send messages to themselves.

### Viewing Received Messages:
